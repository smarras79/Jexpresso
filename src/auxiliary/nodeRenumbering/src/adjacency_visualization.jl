    adjacency_visualization(RCM_adjacency::Dict{Int, Vector{Int}})

Visualizes adjacency graph Dicts as matrices. Result can be plotted using `PyPlot` function `matshow()`.
A part of the Reverse Cuthill-McKee Algorithm.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> RCM_adjacency = Dict{Int, Vector{Int}}(
                       7 => [5, 6, 9],
                       9 => [7, 8],
                       4 => [2, 6],
                       2 => [4, 3, 1],
                       3 => [5, 6, 2, 1],
                       8 => [6, 9],
                       5 => [7, 3],
                       6 => [7, 3, 8, 4],
                       1 => [3, 2]);
