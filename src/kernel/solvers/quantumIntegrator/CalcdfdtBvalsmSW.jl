function CalcdfdtBvalsmSW(U,Gamma,ff_Bvals,dffdt_vals,d, 
    Tot_Int_Pts)
#CALCDFDTBVALSMSW assigns dff/dt boundary values - shock-wave absent
#   CalcdfdtBvalsmSW uses flow boundary conditions to assign values to
#       first time derivative of ODE driver function at nozzle entrance
#       & exit when shock-wave absent. Formulas below are based on 
#       analysis in 5-1-2019 entry of my research notebook.
#
#   INPUTS:
#           U = d x Tot_X_Pts array storing primary flow variables at all()
#                   grid-points.
#           Gamma = ratio of specific heats
#           ff_Bvals = d x 2 array storing "values" of ODE driver function
#                           at nozzle entrance & exit.
#           dffdt_vals = d x Tot_Int_Pts array storing values of first 
#                           time derivative of ODE driver function at all()
#                           interior grid-points.
#           d = number of primary flow variables at each grid-point
#           Tot_Int_Pts = number of interior grid-points
#
#   OUTPUT:
#           dffdt_Bvals = d x 2 array storing "values" of first time
#                               derivative of ODE driver function at
#                               nozzle entrance & exit.
