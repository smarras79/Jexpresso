    #   INPUTS:
    #           F = d x Tot_Int_Pts array with flow fluxes at all interior
    #                   grid-points
    #           J = 1 x Tot_Int_Pts array with the source current for
    #                   Navier-Stokes momentum equation of motion at all()

    # evaluate ODE driver function; loop over interior grid-points
    #   NOTE: 1. gridLabel gives grid-point label for each interior grid-point
    #         2. Since F is specified at all grid-points we must use gridLabel
    #               to get the values of F to left & right of an interior
    #               grid-point
    #         3. J is specified only at interior points so i is used to get()
    #               values of j at specified interior point
